      Our legal basis for the processing of personal data is our legitimate business interests, described in more detail below, although we will also rely on contract, legal obligation and consent for specific uses of data.
      <br>
      <br>
      We will rely on contract if we are negotiating or have entered into a placement agreement with you or your organisation or any other contract to provide services to you or receive services from you or your organisation.
      <br>
      <br>
      We will rely on legal obligation if we are legally required to hold information on to you to fulfil our legal obligations – including where you are applying for roles or are placed in a role where you will be working with vulnerable persons such as children.
      <br>
      <br>
      We will in some circumstances rely on consent for particular uses of your data and you will be asked for your express consent if legally required.  Examples of when consent may be the lawful basis for processing include permission to introduce a Candidate to a Client and in relation to sending third-party marketing communications to you via email
      <br>
      <br>
      With respect to marketing, if you have previously engaged with us (for example submitting a job application or CV or registering for a vacancy to be filled) and we are marketing other recruitment related services we will take your consent as given unless or until you opt out (this is called soft opt-in consent). For other types of e-marketing, we are required to obtain your explicit consent.  You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us on philippa@silverswanrecruitment.com.
      <br>
      <br>
      Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you. In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
    </p>
    <h5 class="maroon privacy-subtitle">Our Legitimate Business Interests:</h5>
    <p class="grey tiny-text privacy-text">
      Our legitimate interests in collecting and retaining your personal data are described below:
      <ul>
        <li class="grey tiny-text">In order to support our Candidates’ career aspirations and our Clients’ resourcing needs, we require a database of Candidate and Client personal data containing historical information as well as current resourcing requirements.</li>
        <li class="grey tiny-text">As a recruitment agency, we introduce Candidates to Clients for employment opportunities. The exchange of personal data of our Candidates and our  Client contacts is a fundamental, essential part of this process.</li>
        <li class="grey tiny-text">We think that it is reasonable to expect that if you are looking for employment or have posted your professional background and information on a job board or professional networking site which allows the public (including recruiters) to view your information that you are happy for us to collect and otherwise use your personal data to offer or provide our recruitment services to you, assess your skills against our bank of vacancies and, with your consent, share that information with prospective employers.</li>
        <li class="grey tiny-text">Once an offer of a role is made to a Candidate, your prospective employer may also want to double check any information you’ve given us (such as the results from credit and criminal records/DBS checks or confirm your references and qualifications) to the extent that this is appropriate and necessary for the role.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h5 class="maroon privacy-subtitle">Consent</h5>
    <p class="grey tiny-text privacy-text">
      Should we want or need to rely on consent to lawfully process your data we will request your consent orally, by email or by an online process for the specific activity we require consent for and record your response on our system.  Where consent is the lawful basis for our processing you have the right to withdraw your consent to this particular processing at any time (as set out below under Your legal rights).
    </p>
    <h5 class="maroon privacy-subtitle">Establishing or defending legal claims:</h5>
    <p class="grey tiny-text privacy-text">
      Sometimes it may be necessary for us to process personal data and, where appropriate and in accordance with local laws and requirements, special category personal data in connection with exercising or defending legal claims.
      <br>
      <br>
      This may arise for example where we need to take legal advice in relation to legal proceedings or are required by law to preserve or disclose certain information as part of the legal process.
    </p>
    <h5 class="maroon privacy-subtitle">Change of purpose:</h5>
    <p class="grey tiny-text privacy-text">
      We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us on philippa@silverswanrecruitment.com. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
      <br>
      <br>
      Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
    </p>
    <h5 class="maroon privacy-subtitle">Automated Decision Making or Profiling:</h5>
    <p class="grey tiny-text privacy-text">
      We do not undertake automated decision making or profiling. We do use our computer systems to search and identify personal data in accordance with parameters set by a person. A person will always be involved in the decision-making process.

      <br>
      <br>

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers in the UK.

In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
      <br>
      <br>

    <h5 class="maroon privacy-subtitle">Retention of your data:</h5>
    <p class="grey tiny-text privacy-text">
      We understand our legal duty to retain accurate data and only retain personal data for as long as we need it for our legitimate business interests and where you are happy for us to do so.

      <br>
      <br>
      To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
      <br>
      <br>
      We may archive part or all of your personal data or retain it on our financial systems only, deleting all or part of it from our main Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) system. We may pseudonymise parts of your data, particularly following a request for suppression or deletion of your data, to ensure that we do not re-enter your personal data on to our database unless requested to do so.

      <br>
      <br>
